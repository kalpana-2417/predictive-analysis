In this task, the dataset (hpi_master.csv) was loaded and prepared for predictive modeling. Initial steps included handling missing values, checking data types, and removing or imputing null entries where necessary. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was conducted to understand the distribution of variables, identify outliers, and detect potential patterns or trends. Visualizations such as line plots, histograms, and correlation heatmaps were used to analyze housing price trends over time and across regions.

Furthermore, relevant features were selected based on correlation and domain knowledge to be used in the predictive model. The dataset was then transformed and normalized where appropriate, ensuring it was ready for model training in the next stage.
